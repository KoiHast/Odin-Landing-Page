        <h2>It all started with a dream...</h2>
        <p>
          The concept behind Blue Hour Photography started with a simple dream
          of mine. I wanted to be able to take those special moments in people's
          lives and turn those memories into physical objects that could be
          shared. No matter how important they are to us, memories fade. The
          thought of having such precious moments lost to time has always
          bothered me; I wanted to be the catalyst in stopping that.<br /><br />
          Through my photographs, I aim to not only capture the look of an
          image. I want to capture a moment in time. I want my clients to be
          able to look at an image of their wedding and taste the cake on their
          tongue. I want them to look at a photo of their newborn baby and hear
          their first laugh. I want to capture the very essence of the moment
          with every click of my camera.<br /><br />
          I started my business back in 2014 with nothing but myself, a
          secondhand DSLR camera, and hope for the future. I took on some
          friends and family as clients to build my portfolio, and I quickly
          started getting my name out into my local community. After having to
          take a hiatus due to Covid-19 in 2020, I'm finally starting to build
          back my clientele and work towards growing my dream even more!

        <h2>My specializations</h2>
        <p>
          I specialize in mostly event photography, leaning towards weddings,
          proms, new baby sessions, and other events where the emotion of the
          moment is palpable in the air. <br /><br />I am, however, also able to
          do headshot shoots for those professionals that really want their
          unique personality to shine through their photos.
