# Odin-Landing-Page

The Landing Page project from the online code-learning program "The Odin Project"

This is the first big project assigned so far in the curriculum. There is no base HTML or CSS content given; This project is meant to be built completely from scratch.

In this project, I will be using many of the skills that have been covered in the curriculum, though I feel that FlexBox will be the one most prevalent throughout the code.

For now, the content will be very bare-bones; It's meant to convey that I've understood the source material. I'm not here to show off (yet). I may return to this project at a later date and spice it up a bit.
