# Odin-Landing-Page

The Landing Page project from the online code-learning program "The Odin Project"

This is the first big project assigned so far in the curriculum. There is no base HTML or CSS content given; This project is meant to be built completely from scratch.

In this project, I will be using many of the skills that have been covered in the curriculum, though I feel that FlexBox will be the one most prevalent throughout the code.

The concept I am going off of is one of a freelance photography company. The content may not be as fancy as possible, but I will return later and incrementally update it to look better. For now, I only want to make sure I understand the concepts that I have been taught thus far in the curriculum.
